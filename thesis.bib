abstract = {ABSTRACT The pleural cavity constitutes the most frequent extra-abdominal metastatic site in ovarian carcinoma (OC). In patients with OC and pleural effusions, a positive fluid cytology is required for a stage IV diagnosis. Unfortunately, about 30\% of malignant pleural effusions exhibit false-negative cytological pleural fluid results. In those circumstances, exploratory video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) serves as a diagnostic, staging and even therapeutic modality. Maximal (no visible disease) or, at least, optimal (no residual implant greater than 1 cm) cytoreduction should be the primary surgical goal in stage IV OC patients. This is due to residual tumour after cytoreductive surgery being one of the most important factors impacting on survival. Although malignant pleural effusions do not preclude abdominal surgical debulking, excision of gross pleural nodules may be necessary to achieve optimal cytoreduction. VATS quantifies pleural tumour burden and allows for intrathoracic cytoreduction or, if the latter is not feasible, ensures that abdominal surgery is not unnecessarily performed on women in whom gross tumour would still remain in the pleural space afterwards. Taxane-platinum neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be offered to this group. Patients with tumour extension into the pleural space have a median overall survival of 2 years.},

abstract = "Context
The Gleason grading system is one of the most powerful predictors of outcome in prostate cancer and a cornerstone in counseling and treating patients. Since its inception, it has undergone several modifications triggered by a change in clinical practice and a better understanding of the cancer's histologic spectrum and variants and their prognostic significance.
Objective
To provide an overview of the implementation and the impact of the Gleason system as a predictive and prognostic tool in all available treatment modalities, and to compare the original and modified Gleason systems in major pathologic and clinical outcome data sets.
Evidence acquisition
A comprehensive nonsystematic Medline search was performed using multiple Medical Subject Headings such as Gleason, modified, system, outcome, biopsy, prostatectomy, recurrence, prognosis, radiotherapy, and focal therapy, with restriction to the English language and a preference for publications within the last 10 yr. All Gleason grade–related studies in the last 3 yr were reviewed. For studies before this date, we relied on prior culling of the literature for various recent books, chapters, and original articles on this topic.
Evidence synthesis
Using the modified grading system resulted in disease upgrading with more cancers assigned a Gleason score ≥7 than in the past. It also resulted in a more homogeneous Gleason score 6, which has an excellent prognosis when the disease is organ confined. The vast majority of studies using both systems showed that Gleason grading of adenocarcinomas on needle biopsies and radical prostatectomies was strongly associated with pathologic stage, status of surgical margins, metastatic disease, biochemical recurrence, and cancer-specific survival, with the modified system outperforming the original one in some large series. A description of the continuous incorporation of this parameter in the clinical decision making for treating prostate cancer using all currently used treatment modalities is presented, and the findings of studies before and after the inception of the modified grading system, if available, are compared. The proposed contemporary grading prognostic categories are 3+3, 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9–10.
Conclusions
The Gleason score is one of the most critical predictive factors of prostate cancer regardless of the therapy used. Modernization of the Gleason grading system has resulted in a more accurate grading system for radical prostatectomy (RP) but has complicated the comparison of data before and after the updating. A better prognostication with the updated Gleason grading system for patients treated with modalities other than surgery can only be postulated at this time because there are limited conflicting data on radiation and no studies on other treatment modalities. Its greatest impact is the uniformly excellent prognosis associated with Gleason score 6 in RPs."

	abstract = {Purpose
This paper reviews the research literature on text mining (TM) with the aim to find out (1) which cancer domains have been the subject of TM efforts, (2) which knowledge resources can support TM of cancer-related information and (3) to what extent systems that rely on knowledge and computational methods can convert text data into useful clinical information. These questions were used to determine the current state of the art in this particular strand of TM and suggest future directions in TM development to support cancer research.
Methods
A review of the research on TM of cancer-related information was carried out. A literature search was conducted on the Medline database as well as IEEE Xplore and ACM digital libraries to address the interdisciplinary nature of such research. The search results were supplemented with the literature identified through Google Scholar.
Results
A range of studies have proven the feasibility of TM for extracting structured information from clinical narratives such as those found in pathology or radiology reports. In this article, we provide a critical overview of the current state of the art for TM related to cancer. The review highlighted a strong bias towards symbolic methods, e.g. named entity recognition (NER) based on dictionary lookup and information extraction (IE) relying on pattern matching. The F-measure of NER ranges between 80\% and 90\%, while that of IE for simple tasks is in the high 90s. To further improve the performance, TM approaches need to deal effectively with idiosyncrasies of the clinical sublanguage such as non-standard abbreviations as well as a high degree of spelling and grammatical errors. This requires a shift from rule-based methods to machine learning following the success of similar trends in biological applications of TM. Machine learning approaches require large training datasets, but clinical narratives are not readily available for TM research due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. This issue remains the main bottleneck for progress in this area. In addition, there is a need for a comprehensive cancer ontology that would enable semantic representation of textual information found in narrative reports.},

	abstract = {Summary
The burden of cancer is growing, and the disease is becoming a major economic expenditure for all developed countries. In 2008, the worldwide cost of cancer due to premature death and disability (not including direct medical costs) was estimated to be US\$895 billion. This is not simply due to an increase in absolute numbers, but also the rate of increase of expenditure on cancer. What are the drivers and solutions to the so-called cancer-cost curve in developed countries? How are we going to afford to deliver high quality and equitable care? Here, expert opinion from health-care professionals, policy makers, and cancer survivors has been gathered to address the barriers and solutions to delivering affordable cancer care. Although many of the drivers and themes are specific to a particular field—eg, the huge development costs for cancer medicines—there is strong concordance running through each contribution. Several drivers of cost, such as over-use, rapid expansion, and shortening life cycles of cancer technologies (such as medicines and imaging modalities), and the lack of suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies, have converged with more defensive medical practice, a less informed regulatory system, a lack of evidence-based sociopolitical debate, and a declining degree of fairness for all patients with cancer. Urgent solutions range from re-engineering of the macroeconomic basis of cancer costs (eg, value-based approaches to bend the cost curve and allow cost-saving technologies), greater education of policy makers, and an informed and transparent regulatory system. A radical shift in cancer policy is also required. Political toleration of unfairness in access to affordable cancer treatment is unacceptable. The cancer profession and industry should take responsibility and not accept a substandard evidence base and an ethos of very small benefit at whatever cost; rather, we need delivery of fair prices and real value from new technologies.},

	abstract = {This book from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the  specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization, provides a  unique global view of cancer, including cancer patterns, causes, and  prevention. The World Cancer Report series is recognized as an  authoritative source of global perspective and information on cancer.  The first volume appeared in 2003 and the second in 2008. This third  volume in the series encompasses both established knowledge and recent  research achievement. 
 World Cancer Report provides a professional, multidisciplinary  assessment of all aspects of the geographical distribution, biology,  etiology, prevention, and control of cancer, predicated on research. The  concise nature of the text and the high graphic content (hundreds of  colour maps, diagrams, and photographs) make the publication accessible  to a broad readership. World Cancer Report is designed to provide  non-specialist health professionals and policy-makers with a balanced  understanding of cancer control and to provide established cancer  professionals with insights about recent development.
 The book includes chapters in which distinguished scientists from around  the world provide a broad overview of established knowledge and then  emphasize research activity and progress. In addition, text boxes  distributed throughout the book provide short, in-depth discussions of  selected questions or topics. A new feature of this volume is the  inclusion of Perspectives considering the future development of  different aspects of cancer research, written by those whose record of  outstanding achievement qualifies them as individuals having unique  vision.
 Includes more than 60 chapters with contributions from more than 150  distinguished scientists from around the world, with information on: . Cancer Worldwide . Cancer Etiology . Cancer Biology . Cancer Prevention . Cancer by Organ Site . Cancer Control},
