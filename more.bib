	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473},
	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE A substantial portion of medical data is unstructured. Extracting data from unstructured text presents a barrier to advancing clinical research and improving patient care. In addition, ongoing studies have been focused predominately on the English language, whereas inﬂected languages with non-Latin alphabets (such as Slavic languages with a Cyrillic alphabet) present numerous linguistic challenges. We developed deeplearning–based natural language processing algorithms for automatically extracting biomarker status of patients with breast cancer from three oncology centers in Bulgaria.
METHODS We used dual embeddings for English and Bulgarian languages, encoding both syntactic and polarity information for the words. The embeddings were subsequently aligned so that they were in the same vector space. The embeddings were used as input to convolutional or recurrent neural networks to derive the biomarker status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.
RESULTS We showed that we can resolve ambiguity in highly variable medical text containing both Latin and Cyrillic text. Final models incorporating both English and Bulgarian syntax and polarity embeddings achieved F1 scores of 0.90 or higher for all estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 biomarkers. The models were robust against human errors originally found in the training set. In addition, such models can be extended for analyzing text containing words not seen during training.
CONCLUSION By using several techniques that incorporate dual-word embeddings encoding syntactic and polarity information in two languages followed by deep neural network architectures, we show that researchers can extract and normalize parameters within medical data. The principles described here can be used to analyze Cyrillic or Latin mixed medical text and extract other parameters.},

	abstract = {The pervasive use of electronic health databases has increased the accessibility of free-text clinical reports for supplementary use. Several text classification approaches, such as supervised machine learning (SML) or rule-based approaches, have been utilized to obtain beneficial information from free-text clinical reports. In recent years, many researchers have worked in the clinical text classification field and published their results in academic journals. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) has recapitulated the existing primary studies on clinical text classification in the last five years. Thus, the current study aims to present SLR of academic articles on clinical text classification published from January 2013 to January 2018. Accordingly, we intend to maximize the procedural decision analysis in six aspects, namely, types of clinical reports, data sets and their characteristics, pre-processing and sampling techniques, feature engineering, machine learning algorithms, and performance metrics. To achieve our objective, 72 primary studies from 8 bibliographic databases were systematically selected and rigorously reviewed from the perspective of the six aspects. This review identified nine types of clinical reports, four types of data sets (i.e., homogeneous–homogenous, homogenous–heterogeneous, heterogeneous–homogenous, and heterogeneous–heterogeneous), two sampling techniques (i.e., over-sampling and under-sampling), and nine pre-processing techniques. Moreover, this review determined bag of words, bag of phrases, and bag of concepts features when represented by either term frequency or term frequency with inverse document frequency, thereby showing improved classification results. SML-based or rule-based approaches were generally employed to classify the clinical reports. To measure the performance of these classification approaches, we used precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, AUC, and specificity in binary class problems. In multi-class problems, we primarily used micro or macro-averaging precision, recall, or F-measure. Lastly, open research issues and challenges are presented for future scholars who are interested in clinical text classification. This SLR will definitely be a beneficial resource for researchers engaged in clinical text classification.},
